00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,960
Oh no!

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,480
Pun, you're screwed!

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,320
“This pair of shoes is just like me.”

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,680
“Beautiful, lovely…”

5
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,800
“but falling to rock bottom.”

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
“Because of a fool.”

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,600
“And that fool...”

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,360
“is me, also.”

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,680
“My life is falling apart because of myself.”

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
“And probably only me who can pick myself back up.”

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,360
“Deep down, I can only wonder,...”

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,600
“if there will ever be...”

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,160
“someone who will pick me up...”
“and put me back where I used to be.”

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Nice pick.

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,720
This is my all-time favorite.

16
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
(New York City, USA)

17
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,040
Miss Punnakorn…

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Miss Punnakorn…

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
Miss Punnakorn…

20
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,840
Yes?

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
Are you okay, Miss Punnakorn?

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,800
Yeah...

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm okay.

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,040
So…that's it.

25
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
Thank you for being here today.

26
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,840
We'll contact you back later.

27
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,120
Thank you.

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,280
"Why the heck did you give him the money first?"

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,079
What should I do, Jieab?

30
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,720
“Jeez, you’re always like this.”

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,000
"Never think things through."

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
How was I supposed to know?

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,079
We’ve known each other for two years.

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
Besides…

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,960
He's helped me out a lot.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,240
"2 years or 20 years, it doesn't mean you can trust him, right?"

37
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,560
Yeah, I've learned my lesson.

38
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
And now, I really want to know...

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
where the heck Phetai is.

40
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,760
“Took you long enough to come to your senses.”

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,280
"So, when was the last time he texted you?"

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
See?

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
This is the consequence of abandoning your friend to live abroad.

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,519
“Abroad. America. New York…”

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,400
“The city that has everything.”
“Fashion, City of Lights, food, nature…”

46
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,280
“art, museums, art fairs, galleries, Broadway.”
“This is it. My dream city.”

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,159
“That's why I chose to study the designing here.”

48
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,840
“And for the other reason...”

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,520
I caused some trouble with my older sister.

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,800
But that's not the point.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,880
For now, the most important thing is Phetai.

52
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,520
Pun, marry me.

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,520
Come on, we'll get married in name only.

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
You want citizenship, don't you?

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
This is the fastest way.

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,400
“This is Phetai.”

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,480
“He's partnered with a friend named Ohm.”

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,680
“They opened a small restaurant in Brooklyn.”
“Called ‘Let's Eat Thai’.”

60
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,200
“Two years ago, a friend introduced me to Phetai.”

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
“He came to New York when he was young.”

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
“He married an American woman and got his citizenship...”

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,000
“before they divorced almost 10 years ago.”

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
“And he rents out a room in his place for Thai students.”

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
What about my room?

66
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,600
“And I came to share a room with Phe...”

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,480
“Who would have thought that suddenly...”

68
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
“a landlord…”

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,480
“would become my husband-to-be.”

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,600
We'll register our marriage.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,760
Once you get your green card and citizenship...

72
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,080
we can just get a divorce.

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I know that this kind of method exists.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,080
But...

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
Will it really be okay?

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,960
It'll be fine...

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
if we're convincing enough.

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Come on, trust me.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,320
It's better than you marrying some random guy...

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
That you don't even know.

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
How can you just trust someone like that?

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Right?

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,720
But here's the thing, Pun...

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
There are some expenses for it.

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
A million baht!?

86
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
That's a million, Pun!

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,960
Yeah, that's why I'm so anxious!

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
And you know what's important...

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,960
It's the money Prang gave me when I graduated.

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,960
"Look, search everywhere today."

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,720
"There has to be something."

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Or if there's anything I can do to help...

93
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
just tell me.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't want to see you so stressed out,...

95
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,760
“spacing out so much like this anymore.”

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,480
Pun?

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,720
"Hey, Pun?"

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,360
I haven't even finished my sentence...

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,760
and you're spacing out again.

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,680
No, I'm not. It's just...…

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,480
thought I saw someone familiar just now.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,280
But never mind.

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,240
“Be careful, okay?

104
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,440
“Are you home yet?”

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,080
Not yet. I just left the office.

106
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,520
Is this the person you told me about?

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,000
The one who often follows you on the train.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm not sure.

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,360
I've only seen those guys...

110
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,200
at Phetai's restaurant and on the train.

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
I've never seen them follow me all the way here.

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,120
“I think…”
“that Phe guy must have gotten into trouble again.”

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,880
“That's why many people are searching for him.”

114
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm home.

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,600
“Anyone following you?”

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No.

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Okay, I gotta go, Jieab.

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,520
“If anything happens, you call me.”

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,240
Yeah, don't worry. That's all for now.

120
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
Mother…

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,960
Where the heck did your son disappear to?

122
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,280
"Look, search everywhere today."

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,120

Phetai...

128

Nope?

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,400
Or maybe...

If it's this, then don't have one?.

He must have run off
with the money back to Bangkok.

You're his girlfriend, right?

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
No! No…

141
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,160
I want my money back!

I said…where is your phone?

Someone broke into my house.

151
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
They're trying to kill me.

152

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,040
If the police came a little bit later.

170
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
I...

171
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,040
I would have become a ghost in Brooklyn.

172
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,160
Aww...

173
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
Come on.

174
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,080
Think of it as entering a new life.

175
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,360
I hope so.

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Now, eat...

177
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,480
Nom...

178
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
No, I don't want to.

179
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,840
Don't be a baby.

180
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,040
So what's the plan? Going home?

181
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,640
Guys…

182
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Look at me.

183
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
Look!

184
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,040
How can I go back?

185
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,800
And when I go back...

186
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,160
What will I tell dad?

187
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,080
That I was chased and shot at by the mafia?

188
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,680
They would freak out for sure.

189
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,480
[Sobbing]

190
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,400
Feed her some cake.

191
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,960
Eat some cake first.

192
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
No...

193
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,480
When you're down, eat up sweets.

194
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,040
Nom...

195
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah, that's it. Eat!

196
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,600
Eat up...

197
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,280
Is it good?

198
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,600
Dad, have you heard from Pun lately?

199
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
No, I haven't.

200
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,080
What about you, Prang?

201
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,680
Have you spoken to your sister?

202
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
Not at all.

203
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,200
Last time was when she
graduated with her master's.

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
But her birthday is next month.

205
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,920
Should we invite her back here?

206
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,000
Absolutely, great.

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
Miss her.

208
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,400
She's probably busy looking for a job.

209
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,560
But I'll talk to her.

210
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,840
Excuse me…

211
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh, you're here…

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,360
Hello, dad.

213
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,080
- Hello, mom.
- Hello, dear.

214
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,640
I brought some snacks for you.

215
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Thank you.

216
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Well, my favorite girl.

217
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,480
There are two girls here, dad.

218
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
I'm hurt a bit now.

219
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
What is this?

220
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Did I come too early?

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
Not at all, dear.

222
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,840
If you're ready, you can go.

223
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,200
Well then, I'll be going.

224
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Okay, dear.

225
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,680
Goodbye.

226
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,560
Bye bye.

227
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,080
Jay...

228
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Don't cause any more trouble.

229
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Text me when you're at the condo.

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,520
Goodbye.

231
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye-bye.

232
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,400
Are you going to invite Ploy?

233
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,800
I heard she already has plans.

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
Besides…

235
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,800
This is our date.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
I was just asking.

237
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,640
When we go there...

238
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,400
Ploy is always there too.

239
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,840
Okay...

240
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,840
Wait a minute...

241
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,200
You said you weren't jealous anymore.

242
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,920
I am not.

243
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
Really?

244
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Mmm-hmm...

245
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,360
I don't believe you.

246
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
I'm not...

247
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,600
because I'm this precious to you...

248
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,840
No way you could have eyes for anyone else.

249
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,880
So confident.

250
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,560
Shouldn't I be the one saying this?

251
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,320
Who compliments themselves like that?

252
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,960
And am I not precious?

253
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,120
Jay...

254
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,440
Hold on...

255
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,600
This is the pub you were talking about?

256
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,800
It's Nop's pub, Phetai's friend.

257
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
I heard Phe helped him start the place...

258
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,400
before he went to America.

259
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,040
Really?

260
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Jieab...

261
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,040
Can we go there tonight?

262
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,640
Maybe...

263
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,200
Phetai might just show his face there.

264
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,280
Me, again?

265
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,440
I told you, we won't find him.

266
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,800
We've been surveying the place
for a few nights already.

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
Haven't seen him at all.

268
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,280
We've been standing here for an hour.

269
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,640
I haven't even seen a single leg hair of Phe.

270
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,680
Can't I go dance a little?

271
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,360
Or maybe…

272
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,120
Have a little drink?

273
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,520
Stop complaining.
We're here to help Pun tonight.

274
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,480
That’s what good friends do.

275
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,040
To be a spy, you've got to blend in,
don't you think?

276
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
I agree.

277
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
I don't like your face.

278
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,880
Oh, you little...

279
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,960
Pun...

280
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,480
Are you okay?

281
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,800
We can go back first.

282
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,120
I'm okay.

283
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,440
Probably just a little jet-lagged.

284
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,080
Okay, I'm gonna...

285
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,680
go wash my face first.

286
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
I'll be right back.

287
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,560
Can you go alone...

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,880
“Is that Phetai?”

289
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,120
“Smells so good...”

290
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
Are you okay?

291
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,120
I'm fine. Excuse me.

292
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
Huh...

293
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,080
Where are Best and Krit?

294
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
They went to get drinks.

295
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,600
In the end, Krit has worn down.

296
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,080
It's fun, you know.

297
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,800
Just satisfying Best's urge.

298
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,040
And after this...

299
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll help you find information on Nop's address.

300
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,120
If we can find the pub owner, Nop...

301
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm sure we can trace it back to Phe.

302
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,040
Satisfying Best's urge...

303
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,280
or your own urge, Jieab?

304
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Everyone's.

305
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,560
We're not going to find Phe anyway.

306
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Let's just have some fun.

307
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,840
And celebrate your return.

308
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,320
You know...

309
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,680
that I've quit drinking.

310
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
Tonight, keep the nun inside...

311
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,840
and let the little demon out.

312
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,560
We'll take care of the demon for you.

313
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
We won't let you get into trouble with anyone.

314
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
I'm not drinking.

315
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,000
Come on, just a little, Pun.

316
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,880
Letting loose won't hurt.

317
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Look at Best.
She's even wilder, and that's okay.

318
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,400
- Thanks for the compliment.
- You're welcome.

319
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,400
No!

320
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
Pun...

321
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,480
Come on, just a little.

322
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
You just came from the City of Lights.

323
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,960
Aren’t you back with anything?

324
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
Come on, don't worry.

325
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,600
Tonight, we'll take care of you.

326
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm not drinking!

327
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,920
No!

328
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,120
No!

329
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
No...

330
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
Well, it'll probably be fine!

331
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,240
Oh no!

332
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,400
Pun, you're screwed!

333
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,160
Nice pick.

334
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,320
This is my all-time favorite.

335
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,600
No...

336
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm not stealing them.

337
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
Wait...

338
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
Who are you?

339
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
And what am I doing here?

340
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,040
Kidnapping?

341
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,960
Ransom?

342
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,400
Or...

343
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,680
Do I look like a thief?

344
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,440
Well...

345
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,080
Not really.

346
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,040
It would be a long story.

347
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,200
Let's just say you were very drunk last night.

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,280
So I brought you here.

349
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I've washed your clothes.

350
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,880
But I think...

351
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,200
the outfit might not be appropriate for...

352
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,520
taking a taxi or the skytrain home.

353
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,520
If you don't mind...

354
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,640
you can wear my clothes.

355
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,120
The bathroom is that way.

356
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,760
Make yourself at home.

357
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
Wait,

358
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,880
I think…

359
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,680
You shouldn't walk around
in a blanket like that.

360
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,360
You should know that I'm...

361
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,640
Naked.

362
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm afraid you might trip.

363
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,360
I'm okay.

364
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,960
And I promise...

365
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,800
that I will put your blanket...

366
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
back on the bed, neat and tidy.

367
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,360
If you would be so kind as to...

368
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,040
Leave me alone.

369
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
Okay.

370
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
I wasn't expecting a guest.

371
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
So I didn't tidy up.

372
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,000
I was just wondering...

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,480
Last night...

374
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,040
The two of us probably didn't…

375
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,320
Don't worry.

376
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,880
The marks on your body...

377
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,600
are not from these things.

378
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,120
I'll be outside...

379
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,120
and leave you to your private time
in the bathroom.

380
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,400
In case you remember anything.

381
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,960
Okay.

382
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,280
“What the hell happened last night?”

383
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,000
“And that woman...”

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,160
Ugh! I can't remember.

385
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
What?

386
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,520
“For someone who is hungover.”

387
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,880
Prang...

388
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,280
No wonder she looked familiar.

389
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,640
Ploy Pitcha...

390
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,200
("Heartpop Television")

391
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,160
You two can talk first.

392
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
I'll be right back.

393
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
Okay.

394
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
Hey!

395
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,440
Flirt with my Charles again...

396
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

397
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,360
Flirt with my Charles again...

398
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,160
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

399
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,680
Flirt with my Charles again...

400
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,400
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

401
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,280
Remember that!

402
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,360
Focus!

403
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,800
Flirt with my Charles again...

404
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,080
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

405
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,320
I know of it even without watching the series.

406
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,120
She was in a series with Prang...

407
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,880
They must be close.

408
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,120
“I couldn't find you...”

409
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,080
“so I had to leave without saying goodbye.”

410
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
“Please contact me at this number...”

411
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,880
“so I can return you your clothes”

412
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,400
“P.S.”

413
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,920
“Thank you for not letting me...”

414
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,160
“fall asleep with makeup on my face.”

415
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,080
“From whoever is currently hungover.”

416
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,960
Hello.

417
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
Waanjieab...

418
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
Pun!

419
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,240
Are you safe?

420
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,000
Where are you now?

421
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
I've been worried sick.

422
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,640
You!

423
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
You said you would take good care of me.

424
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Why did you lose me, then?

425
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,560
You're a person, not a primary school eraser.

426
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,880
You can't just get lost.

427
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
You disappeared on your own.

428
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
We were looking all over for you.

429
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,600
We didn't even get any sleep.

430
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,760
Yeah, let's talk about that later.

431
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,040
Come and get me right now.

432
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,440
And where are you?

433
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm at a condo…

434
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
(“The Deviana”)

435
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,680
Prang's condo!

436
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm at Prang's condo.

437
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,360
Prang's condo?

438
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
So you're at Prang's condo?

439
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,480
But I called Prang last night…

440
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,200
She said you weren't there.

441
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
You called Prang too?

442
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,360
I was worried!
What was I supposed to do?

443
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,320
You're lucky I didn't call your parents.

444
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,200
Let's talk about that later.

445
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,720
But right now,
you need to come and get me, quick.

446
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,640
Bring my clothes, my things…

447
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,080
all of my personal stuff.

448
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,680
Because I'm borrowing someone else's phone right now.

449
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,520
I feel bad.

450
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,240
We can talk about everything else here.

451
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,040
And importantly...

452
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
bring food...

453
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,840
Lots of it.

454
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm hungry.

455
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,640
That’s all.

456
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,960
Pun...

457
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Hey...

458
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,400
My phone...

459
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,440
Can I have it back?

460
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Sorry.

461
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,280
“Why, pressed so hard.”

462
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,680
Seems like you're so starving, Pun.

463
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,360
Are you going to tell me...

464
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Why you warped here?

465
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,560
You first.

466
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Tell me…

467
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,480
what happened last night after I got drunk.

468
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
Your inner goddess came out.

469
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,640
Once you're drunk, nothing can stop you.

470
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Here, I'll tell you what happened.

471
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,080
Cheers?

472
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,240
“Wait a minute…”

473
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
“Who is this dude?”

474
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,440
“Just some guy who tried to hit on you.”

475
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,560
“Let me continue...”

476
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,480
You got a problem with my friend?

477
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
None of your business.

478
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,600
What!

479
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,320
So what are you gonna do?

480
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,560
"That was actually a middle finger, not a thumb."

481
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,840
“Ugh, so dramatic. Why even bother censoring it!”

482
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Please don't do anything to my wife.

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Huh! How did you get here?
Go away!

484
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,080
Who the hell are you!?
Go away!

485
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,880
Why are you back?

486
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,680
Go!

487
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,960
You still back?

488
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Go away!

489
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,360
Are you messing with me?
Don't mess with me!

490
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,680
Pun!

491
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,840
Oh!

492
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,040
That’s it.

493
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
The star of the faculty when she's drunk...

494
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
is just a dog.

495
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,360
Awooo...

496
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,160
If you're going to puke, do it properly.

497
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,320
Woof! Woof!

498
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,000
Hello?

499
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,240
What!

500
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,840
And how's Best?

501
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,199
Yeah? Okay.

502
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,320
I'll be right there.

503
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,679
You...

504
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm going in to help them.

505
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,480
You stay here, don't go anywhere.

506
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,239
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,880
I'll be right back.

508
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,920
Okay, hello?

509
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,639
And when I came back to for you...

510
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,520
You were gone.

511
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,880
And...

512
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
How are Best and Krit?

513
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,440
Those two are passed out at my place.

514
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,159
So, are you going to tell me...

515
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
Why you're here?

516
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,639
Do you know…

517
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,280
Ploy Pitcha?

518
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,199
Flirt with my Charles again...

519
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,199
and I'll slap you with a Dior!

520
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,320
Yeah.

521
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,800
She really is famous, obviously.

522
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,440
Why?

523
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,040
Did you meet a celebrity?

524
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
She's gorgeous?

525
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,840
She is.

526
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,640
Beautiful smiles.

527
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,360
Infinite aura!

528
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,920
Smells good.

529
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,200
Geez, Pun.

530
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Did you really meet her?

531
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,760
Or you were drunk and start kissing her neck?

532
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,360
To be able to smell her like that.

533
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,600
Hey, well...

534
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
She's the one who brought me here.

535
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,480
And...

536
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,760
Did she do anything to you?

537
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,640
I just heard a rumor...

538
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,920
that she's secretly hooking up with girls.

539
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
Well...

540
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
It seems like she helped me.

541
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,160
But...

542
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Did we hook up? I'm...

543
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,520
not sure.

544
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,560
But here's the highlight.

545
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,040
Before I left her room...

546
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,080
I found a picture of Phetai’s mom!

547
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,160
Are you sure?

548
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,840
Don't old people look the same?

549
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
They don't.

550
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,720
I've been staring at her picture for over two years.

551
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
Like, she's my own relative.

552
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,760
So, you're saying...

553
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
This Ploy...

554
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,400
knows Phetai?

555
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
It's possible.

556
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,680
And if we investigate Ploy Pitcha...

557
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,040
We might find out where Phetai is.

558
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,080
Pun...

559
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Why are you complicating things?

560
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,240
Your dad is a high-ranking police officer.

561
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,440
Why don't you just ask him for help?

562
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,800
I don't want him to worry.

563
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
But this could be a fraud case, Pun.

564
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,040
I'll investigate it myself.

565
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,440
If you don't want to help,
that’s okay.

566
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,360
Fine.

567
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I'll help.

568
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,680
And what makes you so sure...

569
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,920
about this Ploy person?

570
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,960
Instinct.

571
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,240
How many times has your instinct
gotten you into trouble?

572
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,680
But this time I'm sure, Jieab.

573
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,280
That this Ploy Pitcha...

574
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,640
must have what I'm looking for.

575
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,960
What's that over there?

576
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,480
Where?

577
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,840
“I was panicking last night,
Prang was the first person I called. ”

578
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,000
“I accidentally told her
you were back in Thailand.”

579
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
“You should talk to Prang...”

580
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,040
“she must be very worried by now.”

581
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,200
Let's do it!

582
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,960
Prang...

583
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:49,000
“I don't know how to start explaining...”
“what I did to Prang and Jay.”

584
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,320
“All I can say is
Prang was very angry with me then.”

585
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,080
“That’s made me run away
to New York for two years.

586
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,760
“Even though Prang called
and explained everything to me…”
“that it was all a misunderstanding.”

587
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,520
“It's still…”

588
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,440
“hard for me.”

589
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,680
“I've imagined this day many times.”

590
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,280
“Imagined what today would be like.”

591
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,680
“That I would open up with Prang.
That we would cry our eyes out.”

592
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,800
“Or a scene where Prang scolds me.”

593
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,840
“Turns out, I'm the only one
who hasn't moved on.”

594
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,640
“And what more is…”

595
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
“I feel even worse about the money.”

596
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
A lot has happened...

597
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
in the two years you were gone, Pun.

598
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,840
I'm really happy for you two.

599
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
About what happened back then…

600
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,960
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
Pun.

602
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,520
We aren't holding onto it anymore.

603
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,840
Right?

604
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,880
And another thing…

605
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,720
I told you, it wasn't your fault.

606
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,120
You, please stop overthinking.

607
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,240
I'm glad you're back.

608
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,280
[Doorbell rings]

609
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,680
Oh, Ploy...

610
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
you're here.

611
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,360
“But I'm sure, Jieab.”

612
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,560
“That this Ploy Pitcha...”

613
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,960
“must have what I'm looking for.”

614
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,320
"Is that Phetai?"

615
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,960
Are you okay?

616
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,360
("Next episode".)

617
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,760
So...
What happened last night?

618
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Why did I end up in your room?

619
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,240
Call me "P'Ploy" first,

620
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,960
and then I'll tell you.

621
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,840
"Seriously, who wrote her into my scene today?"

622
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,880
A dessert to say thank you.

623
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,400
How can a person be so needlessly cute all the time?

624
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,240
Does Ploy have any siblings?

625
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,480
Or...

626
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,640
Does she have a girlfriend yet?

627
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,120
What's with all the questions?

Is there something going on?

628
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,160
I have a plan.

629
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,840
I'll just use my charm for a bit,

630
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,840
get the information, and then pull back.

631
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,600
Have you really thought this through?

632
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,800
Ploy is like a flower that lures in insects.

633
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,960
Just a sweet glance from her, and people swarm.

634
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,640
What will you do if she actually starts to like you?

635
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,680
That day... I think I might have lost an earring in your room.

636
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
For your first time, Pun...

637
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,520
You should find someone less wicked than Ploy.

638
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,800
However much she feels for you...

639
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,920
I curse you to feel a hundred times more for her.
